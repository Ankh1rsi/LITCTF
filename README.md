**LITCTF** —is a school group created by students for students of the Lyceum of Information Technology No. 28. Our main goal is to prepare a strong and cohesive team to participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, such as the All—Russian Olympiad of Schoolchildren on Information Security and other cyber competitions.

We believe that the best way to learn something is to do it together. Our club is an open and friendly community where everyone, from beginners to experienced enthusiasts, can develop their information security skills.
